# Intro To Typescript - Exercise
This repo contains some code for a TypeScript quiz. But currently it's broken.

## Installation
1. Clone this repo
2. Navigate to the repo and install packages: `npm install`
3. Run TypeScript with `npm run build`

## Running the App
Once the app is built, you can run it with `npm run start`

> Note: If you'd like to see what the `npm run build` and `npm run start` instructions are doing, check the `scripts` section in the `package.json`

## Instructions
1. Use the TypeScript compiler errors to identify problems in the code. Most of these problems will be missing types, but one is a genuine bug!
2. Once you've fixed the compiler errors, run the quiz. See if you can get all of the answers right!
